This room |is| so quiet, I can here the sound of silence
|Right here| in your arms and |I'm falling asleep to| your heartbeat
It's just you and i
Shadows in the passing headlights
And I think for a moment, |you won't let go of me|

Why don't you put the fucking phone down
Darling, so we |could| be alone now
Can't you just be here when the lights go out
Why don't you ever put that phone down
What |could| be so good damn important
That it can't wait until the morning
You got me right |here with| my close of now
Why don't you put that fucking phone down

|Yeah, the first thing| you do is when i reach out my hand to touch you
|Are you hiding| something from me cause you |moved| when i get close
You |are| killing the moment the window is closing
It's only suppused to be two of us
Put that phone down
Please put the phone down

Why don't you put the fucking phone down
Darling, so we |could| be alone now
Can't you just be here when the lights go out
Why don't you ever put that phone down
What |could| be so good damn important
That it can't wait until the morning
You got me right |here with| my close of now
Why don't you put that fucking phone down

Now I'm felling awkward
It's actually torture
You |are| making a full of the both of us
Put the phone down
Please put the phone down
Why don't you put that fucking phone down
Darling, so we |could| be alone now
Can't you just be here when the lights go out
Just put that phone down
