We can build a treehouse in the pine trees
We can keep our secrets burried underneath
Wildflowers crash between your fingers
|Clinging| to the wild things that raised us

Compass points you home calling |out| from the east
Compass points you anywhere closer to me
If we make it out alive from the depth of the sea
Compass points you anywhere closer to me

Where you are i'll be, milles high in the deep
Where you are i will be, anywhere |in-between|

Take me to the |garden| of your ecstasy
Make myself a |headband| from your fallen |leaves|
Woven in |the| fabric of your tapestry
Cover me in honeysuckle memories

I |will| take the pieces put them back together
Even when the grass isn't green enough
Taking all the |branches| build ourselves a |mansion|
Love you in |the| way that you needed love
Where you are i will be
Where you are i will be, miles high in the deep
Where you are i will be, anywhere and between
